# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose: This project help us to understand the outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. From the data that we analyze will help us take better strategic steps for upcoming campaigns that can reduce the number of failed or canceled strategies.

## Analysis and Challenges
- I did my analysis based on the available data from the Kickstarter.xlsx file, using the formula to convert the timestamps into a day-month-year format, the percent formula, using some functions like year(), countif(), sum(), and some excel tools.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
- I created a pivot table in a new sheet and and use its function to show the table for Outcomes Based on Launch Date, and use the chart tool to draw the chart.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
- I used countifs() function to find the "Number Successful," "Number Failed," and "Number Canceled" columns, based on the project "outcome," the "goal" amount using the goal ranges, and the Subcategory "plays" 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- I think the difficulty of this chalenge is that I have to use the right functions, calculate the data carefully, and understand the requirements of the analysis.
